# jorgicio-website

This is [my personal website](https://www.jorgicio.net), which will be the 7.0 version.

## Tools and stuff used in this project:
 * Yarn (for managing packages)
 * Vue 2
 * Nuxt
 * Tailwind CSS 2 (v3 is incompatible with Nuxt stable; Nuxt 3 is in [beta](https://v3.nuxtjs.org))
 * Pug (formerly Jade) for preprocessing HTML
 * Font Awesome for icons

The future website will be static.
