# jorgicio-website

This is [my personal website](https://www.jorgicio.net), which will be the 7.0 version.

## Tools and stuff used in this project:
 * Yarn (for managing packages)
 * Vue 2
 * Nuxt Bridge (transition to Nuxt 3 when stable version was released)
 * Tailwind CSS 3
 * Font Awesome for icons

The future website will be static.
